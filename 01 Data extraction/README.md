Here is explained how to extract the data from the Faculty of Science pages.

An example of these pages is shown in the next figure:

We use the SelectorGadget app from Google Chrome. [SelectorGadget-Source](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=es)

The icon of the app is a magnifying glass.

After the app had been installed, the steps to obtain the data are:

1. Click the magnifying glass that will be in the bottom right of the website.

2. Click any element in the website that you would like to select (green).

3. The app will highlight everything that matches with your selection (yellow).

4. If you don't need a selected element, click on it to remove it from the selection (red).

5. If you want more elements in the selection, click on them to add them to the selection.

6. SelectorGadget will generate a minimal CSS selector for the elements you choose.


In the next figure we can see the results of the steps we just described.
