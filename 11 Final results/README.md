# Final results

Here we can find several examples of the final matrices with different assignments. Each pdf document in its name has the information about the number of generations and the the size of the population.

Here's an example with the explanation of the names' format:
**_mat_asig_s20202_g03_n05_m004_U599_**

_s20202_ is the semester of the matrix.

_g03_ is the number of generations in the Genetic Algorithm.

_n05_ is the number of elements in the population.

_m004_ is the mutation probability.

_U599_ is the grade of the assignment.
